This was a group project in the program, where me and a partner worked on a chat server and a chat client and utilizing multithreading. As most of the projects we worked on, the backend is in Java and the front-end is Javascript
(using Node)

I closely modeled it to IRC, which is what I have been used to my entire life.

I was having some issues in IntelliJ with JAXB, but Eclipse worked perfectly.

To start the server
-
* Import as maven projects
* Change server port if needed in Main.Java
* Run

To start the client
-
* npm install
* npm run build && node ./dist/main.js

Type connect and it will show the requirements.
